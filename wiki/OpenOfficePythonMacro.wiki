 * It is not possible to edit/debug a Python macro within !OpenOffice, it has to be edited with an external editor and can only be executed in !OpenOffice.  Debugging can be a little bit difficult
 * For the development, the script is created in `C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\OpenOffice.org\3\user\Scripts\python`, let's say `SportTracks.py`
 * In the Calc document, go to `Tools->Macros->Macros->Python...`, under `My macros` there should be the `SportTracks/SportTracks.py`
