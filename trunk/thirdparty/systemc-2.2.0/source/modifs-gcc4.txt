After running:
  tar xvf systemc-2.2.0.tgz
  cd systemc-2.2.0
  mkdir objdir
  cd objdir
  ../configure
  make
  
I was facing the following error:
../../../../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp:110: error: ‘getenv’ is not a member of ‘std’
../../../../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp:111: error: ‘strcmp’ was not declared in this scope

I found in the web the following solution:
I had the same compilation issue. I added the following headers in systemc-2.2.0/src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp


#include "string.h"
#include "cstdlib"

After this my make, install and check all passed successfully.

I added the following lines in 
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib> 

then it compiled fine:
make
make install
