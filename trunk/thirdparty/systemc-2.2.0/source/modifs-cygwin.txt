There are a couple of modifications to apply to the systemC source in order to 
compile for cygwin, the instructions can be found at http://www.ht-lab.com/howto/sccygwin/sccygwin.html.


I have reproduced this page hereafter (2/), my own notes follow (3/)

1/ Prerequisites and notes for installation

Do not forget to install g++ and make from the cygwin setup.



2/ This page gives a brief overview on how to install SystemC 2.2 on Window's Cygwin (1.5.24).
Installing Cygwin

Hop over to cygwin's website and follow the installation procedure. I would recommend to do a full installation
Installing SystemC

SystemC's class library and event based simulator can be downloaded from the SystemC.org website. You need to create a login before you can download the files.

I used the following procedure to install it:

   1.
      Download systemc-2.2.0.tgz and write to a suitable location
   2.
      Unzip the file using tar zxvf systemc-2.2.0.tgz
   3.
      Navigate to the systemc-2.2.0 directory
   4.
      Create a subdirectory as per the INSTALL file called objdir
   5.
      Navigate to the objdir directory
   6. create the destination directory mkdir /usr/local/systemc-2.2
   7.
      Execute ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/systemc-2.2
   8.
      Modify the default stack size SC_DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE which you can find in <your_dir>/systemc-2.2.0/src/sysc/kernel/sc_constants.h from 0x10000 to 0x50000

Line 57: const int SC_DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE   = 0x50000;

   9.
      Build systemc using make pthreads
  10.
      Install systemc using make install
  11.
      Check the installation using make pthreads_check, you might get the following error:

/usr/local/systemc-2.2/include/systemc.h:175: error: `std::wctomb' has not been declared
/usr/local/systemc-2.2/include/systemc.h:177: error: `std::wcstombs' has not been declared

  12.
      If this is the case then open /usr/local/systemc-2.2/include/systemc.h and commend out the 2 lines as shown below:
   
Line 175: //    using std::wctomb;
Line 176:        using std::mbstowcs;
Line 177: //    using std::wcstombs;

  13.
      re-run make pthreads_check and all tests should pass

3/ My own notes

3.1/ Building

+ make all the changes indicated above BEFORE configuring

+ configure: 
  showed a problem with the 'missing' script -> Warning

+ compilation:
  setting CXX as indicated in the INSTALL was not required
  make was used instead of gmake

3.2/ Testing

After 
  make install
I run 
     make check

3.3/ Optimizing

Because my entire simulation was too slow in my opinion, I was looking at ways to optimize systemc.

Valgrind showed me that I was spending too much time in context switch so I decided to try to compile with quickthreads rather than pthreads:

  make 

instead of

  make pthreads

-> speed was multiplied by about 8!!
  
Then, I tried to specify that optimization should be done by changing objdir/Makefile: 
  OPT_CXXFLAGS = -O3
changed to
  OPT_CXXFLAGS = -O4

Then  run
  make clean
  make opt
-> this did not change the output
